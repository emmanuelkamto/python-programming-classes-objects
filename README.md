In application, we have multiple classes that are connected to each other. 
We have a "post" blueprint basically, so whenever a new post gets created with 
the specific values like the actual message, and creation date time, etcâ€¦, 
It will have an author, and the author will actually be one of those users object, 
so we have some functions that actually reference the post.
In the "Post" class the user is able to create new post, so we have a blueprint for a post and the same way we can create that post inside the main.py
